## Why I'm starting a blog for Herald

Herald is the first product from [Open Catalysts](https://opencatalysts.tech), which is a product studio I started. I have plans to release more products under Open Catalysts.

While I could write about Herald in the Open Catalysts blog, I want the things about Herald to stay on this domain.

## What can you expect in this blog?

These are the things I'm planning to share here:

-   Features I've planned for Herald
-   Feature releases
-   Behind the scenes details about my thought process among other things
-   Analytics about my revenue, growth etc
-   Anything else that relates to Herald that I think you should know

## A little bit about me

I'm Ilango, a software engineer and indiehacker from India. I'm the maker behind Herald. This and other products under Open Catalysts are a solo operation.

I also write on my personal website where I go into technical details about the things I'm working on.
